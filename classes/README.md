# classes

This directory contains C++ class examples and exercises for the "cpp-zero-to-hero" repository.

- Add your class header (.h / .hpp) and implementation (.cpp) files here.
- Keep small, focused examples that demonstrate class design, constructors, destructors, inheritance, and polymorphism.

You can add a .gitkeep if you prefer an empty directory, but this README provides a short description of the purpose of the directory.
